# About TaoTeG

My technology career started so simply, from the idealistic perceptions of the user viewing the project through the visual design and UX lens of front-end client-side application development, exploring the endless mystery of the internet, computer networks & security, social media and gaming whilst absorbing all the lessons available on OOP, Agile methodologies, code base management (VCS/workflows), best practices, CI, TDD, cloud deployment - shooting the gap between the client and the server with the advent of NodeJS and the exodus from the comfort of the ActionScript/Flash/Flex lands into the wild frontier of the new HTML5 Fullstack JavaScript powered web, reshaped by the savage and endless Browser Wars, each warrior that remains standing tall atop the flickering glow of a billion forgotten gifs, reaching deep into the hardware spoils of victory to drink the GPU accelerated nectar of real-time 3D and physics modelling, eager tendrils from new possibilities slithering into the infinite potential of HPC computing and parallelized cloud-based applications dynamically spanning vast clusters of servers, filled to bursting with RESTful APIs, services, data and open source technologies intertwined in a glorious dance of self-empowering world-changing choreography, each step set in motion by the simplest of pulses, the fundamental on/off - 1/0 - of pure binary zen... of freedom.
